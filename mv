mv file is a file inside of README directory(repository) It was a created by using 'touch mv' to create the file locally on c9. This was then added to current repository by first locally 'git add mv' then commiting it to the git with comments of what it is(for reasoning)the link was previously there so there was no need to re-enter a ssh.
